      <description>3D-to-2D Data Transformations Seismic full waveform inversion is often based on forward modelling in the computationally attractive 2-D domain. Any solution of the 2-D cartesian wave equation inherently carries the assumption of being generated by a line source, extended in the out-of-plane direction, implying that source energy spreads over the surface of a cylinder, and that amplitudes scale with one over square-root of distance. However, realistic point sources like explosives or airguns, fired in a 3-D medium, generate amplitudes that decay with one over distance, since the wavefield expands spherically in all three dimensions.</description>
