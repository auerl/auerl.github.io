      <description>Global anisotropy (SAVANI) Together with colleagues at UPMC Paris (Lapo Boschi), USC Los Angeles (Thorsten Becker) and University of Oxford (Tarje Nissen-Meyer), have developed a new global model of anisotropic shear-velocity variations, called SAVANI, which represents one of the first attempts to map anisotropic wavespeeds at the scale of the entire mantle. While being well correlated with earlier models at long spatial wavelength, our preferred solution, savani, additionally delineates a number of previously unidentified structures, due to its improved resolution in areas of dense coverage.</description>

      <description>Full Waveform Tomography Seismic Full Waveform Tomography has been one of my main interests since my thesis supervisor Prof. Stewart Greenhalgh has introduced me to the topic during the final year of my Master&amp;rsquo;s studies in 2011. Full waveform tomography describes an inverse modeling approach, where information encoded in subtle variations in seismic and acoustic waveforms that have traversed complex media, are mapped back into structural images of the subsurface at scales from medical imaging applications up to dimensions of the whole earth.</description>
