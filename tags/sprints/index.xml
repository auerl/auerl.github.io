      <description>Age-dependency of sprint top speeds TRACKTICS is having a long-term partnership with Fundaci√≥n Real Madrid Clinics (FRMC) where we equip hundreds of football schools under the Real Madrid Brand Umbrella with our GPS performance trackers. In the scope of this partnership we have collected performance data of tens of thousands of youth players, which amounts to what we think is probably the largest data set of its kind.
Based on the Real Madrid dataset we have devised a new model of sprint top speed age-dependency, using simple restricted cubic spline regression (see the figure above).</description>
