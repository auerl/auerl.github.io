[{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" 3D-to-2D Data Transformations Seismic full waveform inversion is often based on forward modelling in the computationally attractive 2-D domain. Any solution of the 2-D cartesian wave equation inherently carries the assumption of being generated by a line source, extended in the out-of-plane direction, implying that source energy spreads over the surface of a cylinder, and that amplitudes scale with one over square-root of distance. However, realistic point sources like explosives or airguns, fired in a 3-D medium, generate amplitudes that decay with one over distance, since the wavefield expands spherically in all three dimensions.\nUsually, geophysicists correct for this amplitude difference and the associated phase shift of π/4 by transforming recorded field data to approximate 2-D, using simplistic asymptotic filter algorithms, operating on a time-sample basis and assuming straight ray paths and a constant velocity medium. The sometimes careless usage of these filters, is in contradiction to their well known limitations. I could show that filtering errors are moderate in purely acoustic situations but become substantial in complex media when arrivals overlap each other or ray paths deviate strongly from straight lines. Normalized root-mean-square deviations up to 5 % and maximum relative time domain errors up to 40 % were found in high contrast media, when full elastic treatment is considered.

An attempt is made to circumvent problems associated with singularities in the wavenumber spectrum by combining a finite-element 2.5-D forward solver and a complex-frequency extension. By shifting the poles off the real axis, they are avoided in the inverse Fourier transform to the frequency domain. I could show that problems associated with the singularities are mitigated and the total number of required wavenumber samples is significantly reduced, as soon as frequencies are allowed to be complex. Reconstructed finite-element 2.5-D seismograms compare very well to reference finite-difference 3-D seismograms. 2.5-D modelling with complex frequencies outperforms asymptotic 3D-to-2D transformation showing very low misfits between 2.5-D and 3-D synthetics.\n","date":1545992820,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545992820,"objectID":"159be3a81496174e764cf1bf2558c97a","permalink":"/project/25d-wfi/","publishdate":"2018-12-28T11:27:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/25d-wfi/","section":"project","summary":"3D-to-2D Data Transformations Seismic full waveform inversion is often based on forward modelling in the computationally attractive 2-D domain.

While being well correlated with earlier models at long spatial wavelength, our preferred solution, savani, additionally delineates a number of previously unidentified structures, due to its improved resolution in areas of dense coverage.\nThis is because the density of the inverse grid ranges between 1.25 ◦ in well sampled to 5◦ in poorly sampled regions, allowing us to resolve regional structure better than it is typically the case in global S-wave tomography. Important features of our model include: (i) A distinct ocean-continent anisotropic signature in the uppermost mantle; (ii) an oceanic peak in above average ξ \u0026gt; 1 which is shallower than in previous models and thus in better agreement with estimates of lithosphere thickness.\nSee a publication about savani at doi:10.1002/2013JB010773 and feel free to download our model and documentation via\nBroadband tomography In my thesis I have presented the theoretical and methological foundations of a new global waveform tomography approach, with the rationale to keep approximate (ray) theory where appropriate (global long-wavelength structure, surface wave dispersion), but to revert to a full-waveform interpretation where necessary (regional scale, non-geometrical wave phenomena). Finite-frequency kernels are being calculated via the spectral element solver AxiSEM (Nissen-Meyer et al. 2014) and a new code called MCkernel (co-developed with Simon Stähler and Martin van Driel). Overall, our method will provide straightforward framework to stepwise improve upon a global background model by re-inverting an updated linear system whenever new (types of) data become available.\nOceanic upper mantle Defining the oceanic lithosphere as a thermal boundary layer allows to explain, to first order, age-dependent bathymetry and isotropic wavespeeds. In contrast, SS precursors and receiver functions suggest a subhorizontal interface within this layer, on top of a radially anisotropic zone. Comparing a suite of geodynamic scenarios against surface-wave dispersion data and seismic discontinuties we find that only weak age dependency of the radially anisotropic zone is compatible with observations. We show that this zone is confined from below by a second, weaker seismic interface.\nWhile azimuthal anisotropy is consistent with LPO of olivine due to asthenospheric flow underneath the lithosphere, radial anisotropy requires additional contributions, perhaps from petrological fabrics or melt ponding. This implies that seismic reflectors previously associated with the base of the lithosphere are instead associated with preserved structures embedded in it. They carry information about plate formation, but have little control on plate deformation.
