    "content": " Global anisotropy (SAVANI) Together with colleagues at UPMC Paris (Lapo Boschi), USC Los Angeles (Thorsten Becker) and University of Oxford (Tarje Nissen-Meyer), have developed a new global model of anisotropic shear-velocity variations, called SAVANI, which represents one of the first attempts to map anisotropic wavespeeds at the scale of the entire mantle. While being well correlated with earlier models at long spatial wavelength, our preferred solution, savani, additionally delineates a number of previously unidentified structures, due to its improved resolution in areas of dense coverage.\nThis is because the density of the inverse grid ranges between 1.25° in well sampled to 5° in poorly sampled regions, allowing us to resolve regional structure better than it is typically the case in global S-wave tomography. Important features of our model include: (i) A distinct ocean-continent anisotropic signature in the uppermost mantle; (ii) an oceanic peak in above average ξ \u0026gt; 1 which is shallower than in previous models and thus in better agreement with estimates of lithosphere thickness.\nYou can find more details about SAVANI and its construction in Auer et al. 2014. Also, feel free to download our model and documentation from my GitHub, if you want to use the model for your own work.\nOceanic upper mantle Defining the oceanic lithosphere as a thermal boundary layer allows to explain, to first order, age-dependent bathymetry and isotropic wavespeeds. In contrast, SS precursors and receiver functions suggest a subhorizontal interface within this layer, on top of a radially anisotropic zone. Comparing a suite of geodynamic scenarios against surface-wave dispersion data and seismic discontinuties we find that only weak age dependency of the radially anisotropic zone is compatible with observations. We show that this zone is confined from below by a second, weaker seismic interface.\nWhile azimuthal anisotropy is consistent with LPO of olivine due to asthenospheric flow underneath the lithosphere, radial anisotropy requires additional contributions, perhaps from petrological fabrics or melt ponding. This implies that seismic reflectors previously associated with the base of the lithosphere are instead associated with preserved structures embedded in it. They carry information about plate formation, but have little control on plate deformation. See Auer et al. 2015.\nSoftware for global tomography During my PhD I developed and contributed to several tools for global tomographic imaging, some of which are publicly available. See:\nPETScinv - A general purpose parallel tomography solver based on PETSc PETScinv is a modular, general purpose tomography solver written in (object oriented) Fortran 2008. PETScinv solves global tomographic imaging problems in parallel using the PETSc component KSP. The scalable linear equations solvers (KSP) module provides an easy-to-use interface to the combination of a Krylov subspace iterative method and a preconditioner (in the KSP and PC components, respectively) or a sequential direct solver.\nThe code currently only supports orthogonal, curvilinear hexahedral basis functions (spherical sections or voxels), but adding modules to treat other parametization strategies (splines, spherical harmonics, wavelets) to discretize the model space, should be straightforward. One can account for different regularization approaches, such as roughness minimization or norm minimization. Tomography results can be exported in a simple ASCII format or as netcdf files, together with an .xdmf file, ready to be explored with ParaView. Get the code via my GitHub.\nFLEXinv - Ray-theoretical surface and body wave sensitivity kernels Flexinv is a Fortran/Python toolbox to create global, adaptive resolution transversely isotropic tomographic models of the entire mantle, via joint inversion of surface-wave dispersion and body-wave traveltimes, in the high-frequency ray approximation. See Auer et al. (2014) and Boschi (2009) for a complete description of the algorithm.\nSome components of the surface wave parts of this code go back to Woodhouse (1981) and Dziewonski \u0026amp; Anderson (1981). The body-wave routines go back to Gu (2005). Crustal corrections are based on CRUST2.0 by Laske et al. (2002). Models are parameterized in curvilinear hexahedrons, whose size is adapted to local ray coverage, following Schäfer et al. (2011). Get the code via my GitHub.\nMCkernel - Broadband waveform sensitivity kernels for seismic tomography MCkernel is a software implementation to calculate seismic sensitivity kernels on arbitrary tetrahedral or hexahedral grids across the whole observable seismic frequency band. These kernels rely on wavefield databases computed via AxiSEM (www.axisem.info), and thus on spherically symmetric models. The advantage is that frequencies up to 0.2 Hz and higher can be accessed.\nSince the usage of irregular, adapted grids is an integral part of regularisation in seismic tomography, MCkernel works in a inversion-grid-centred fashion: A Monte-Carlo integration method is used to project the kernel onto each basis function, which allows to control the desired precision of the kernel estimation.\nAlso, it means that the code concentrates calculation effort on regions of interest without prior assumptions on the kernel shape. The code makes extensive use of redundancies in calculating kernels for different receivers or frequency-pass-bands for one earthquake, to facilitate its usage in large-scale global seismic tomography. MCkernel is available here\n",

    "content": " Full Waveform Tomography Seismic Full Waveform Tomography has been one of my main interests since my thesis supervisor Prof. Stewart Greenhalgh has introduced me to the topic during the final year of my Master\u0026rsquo;s studies in 2011. Full waveform tomography describes an inverse modeling approach, where information encoded in subtle variations in seismic and acoustic waveforms that have traversed complex media, are mapped back into structural images of the subsurface at scales from medical imaging applications up to dimensions of the whole earth.\nAt the core of these methods lie, on one hand, compute intensive forward problems where the seismic or acoustic wave equation is solved to compute \u0026ldquo;sensitivity kernels\u0026rdquo; (essentially reverse mapping functions from waveform or traveltime differences to structure) as well as a large-scale optimization problems, where the sensitivity kernels are used to reconstruct structural models of wave speeds or other physical parameters.\nThere have been a plethora of approaches to solve these problems, pursuing different strategies to compute sensitivity kernels (time domain, frequency domain, approximate methods, full-wave methods) and to solve the inverse problem (conjugate gradient methods, hessian based methods, \u0026hellip;).\nWhile during my MSc thesis I worked on frequency-domain waveform inversion on the exploration (and near surface) scale, during my PhD thesis I focused on methods for whole-earth imaging. In this context I have developed a waveform based imaging method for global tomographiy imaging that is called \u0026ldquo;Broadband Tomography\u0026rdquo; and combines infinite-frequency ray theory for the surface wave portions of the seismogram, with finite-frequency kernels for the body wave portion of the seismic record.\n3D-to-2D Data Transformations My first project in the area of full waveform tomography has been during my MSc thesis where I was investigating detrimental effect of common 3D-to-2D data transformations on frequency domain FWI. This is important because seismic full waveform inversion is often based on forward modelling in the computationally attractive 2-D domain. Any solution of the 2-D cartesian wave equation inherently carries the assumption of being generated by a line source, extended in the out-of-plane direction, implying that source energy spreads over the surface of a cylinder, and that amplitudes scale with one over square-root of distance. However, realistic point sources like explosives or airguns, fired in a 3-D medium, generate amplitudes that decay with one over distance, since the wavefield expands spherically in all three dimensions.\nUsually, geophysicists correct for this amplitude difference and the associated phase shift of π/4 by transforming recorded field data to approximate 2-D, using simplistic asymptotic filter algorithms, operating on a time-sample basis and assuming straight ray paths and a constant velocity medium. The sometimes careless usage of these filters, is in contradiction to their well known limitations. Comparing simulated data using a FDTD forward solver for visco-elastic seismic wave propagation in 3D and 2D media, we could show that filtering errors are moderate in purely acoustic situations but become substantial in complex media when arrivals overlap each other or ray paths deviate strongly from straight lines. Normalized root-mean-square deviations up to 5% and maximum relative time domain errors up to 40% were found in high contrast media, when full elastic treatment is considered. We published our results in Auer et al. 2013. Also feel free to download my thesis or a pdf of my thesis presentation.\n2.5-D Full Waveform Tomography Motivated by the questionable performance of the aforementioned 3D-to-2D filters the second chapter of my thesis investiagted potential of 2.5-D frequency-domain finite-element modelling of seismic wave propagation, which is based on Fourier transforming the 3-D wave equation along the invariant axis to frequency-wavenumber domain and solving the resulting equation for many wavenumber components, thus breaking down the 3-D problem to a large number of 2-D problems. In my thesis I made an attempt to circumvent problems associated with singularities in the wavenumber spectrum by combining a finite-element 2.5-D forward solver and a complex-frequency extension.\nBy shifting the poles off the real axis, they are avoided in the inverse Fourier transform to the frequency domain. I could show that problems associated with the singularities are mitigated and the total number of required wavenumber samples is significantly reduced, as soon as frequencies are allowed to be complex. Reconstructed finite-element 2.5-D seismograms compare very well to reference finite-difference 3-D seismograms. 2.5-D modelling with complex frequencies outperforms asymptotic 3D-to-2D transformation showing very low misfits between 2.5-D and 3-D synthetics.\nBroadband Finite Frequency Kernels Unlike at the exploration scale, tomographic imaging of at the dimension of the whole mantle is with few exceptions still using ray theoretic methods. In my PhDthesis I have presented the theoretical and methological foundations of a new global waveform tomography approach, with the rationale to keep approximate (ray) theory where appropriate (global long-wavelength structure, surface wavedispersion), but to revert to a full-waveform interpretation where necessary (regional scale, non-geometrical wave phenomena). Finite-frequency kernels are being calculated via the spectral element solver AxiSEM (Nissen-Meyer et al. 2014) and a new code called MCkernel. Our imaging method provides a framework to stepwise improve upon a global background model by re-inverting an updated linear system whenever new (types of) data become available.\nThe huge advantage of using numerical methods to compute banana donought kernels as shown in the above figure is that while wave theory breaks down for non-geometrical wave phenomena like Core-diffractions, spectral-element based FF kernels can account for the complex interactions at the core mantle boundary and thus allow imaging those interesting regions of the earths mantle with higher accuracy.\nMy PhD thesis can be downloaded here. Also find my thesis presentation under this link.\n",
