<p>At TRACKTICS we aim to bring sophisticated tactical analytics and performance
stats (which have so far been reserved to elite clubs and players) to the lower
football leagues, by developing a GNSS-IMU based tracking solution that fits
the tight budgets of an average amatuer player or coach, but is yet accurate
enough to provide valuable insights for injury prevention and training control.</p>

<p>One of the key ideas that we have put forward in order to achieve this goal was to
repurpose methods from the field of sensor fusion, commonly used in fields like
autonomous driving or robotics, for the use case of football data enrichment,
thus accounting for potential shortcomings in raw data quality caused by
inexpensive hardware components and allowing our system to achieve state-of-the
art accuracy, akin to that of much more expensive systems.</p>

<p><img src="data.png" width=800 alt="Luigi's Web UI" /></p>

<p>In the following article I am summarizing TRACKTICS&rsquo; (or more accurately, its
tech team&rsquo;s) journey towards achieving this goal. While the focus of this
article is on on our highly-available and fault tolerant data analysis
pipeline (&ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; in the following) I will also touch upon our core
sensor fusion algorithm and our &ldquo;continuous evaluation&rdquo; framework.</p>

<h2 id="system-overview">System overview</h2>

<p>Before going into detail about the &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; I would like to go one step
backwards, and start with delineating the most important business requirements
driving the work of TRACKTICS Tech-team. Most importantly, the target system
architecture was meant to &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>provide high-quality estimation result, superior to what can be achieved
by off-the-shelf fitness TRACKERS and comparable to that of professional
GPS-based football tracking solutions by Catapult or GPSports.</p></li>

<li><p>be optimized for a strong user experience, through exciting Apps, and a
strong emphasis on wearing comfort - in particular we wanted to get rid of
the widely despised &ldquo;Sports-Bras&rdquo; which are used by practically any competitor
system.</p></li>

<li><p>be affordable to the average youth and amateuer player or semi-professional,
and ambitioned Coaches from European 4th leagues and downwards.</p></li>

<li><p>allow for rapid scaling to tens and hundreds of thousand users.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Before I joined TRACKTICS Tech team in 2016, TRACKTICS had already developed
a powerful GNSS-IMU based sensor hardware tailored for the for the logging of
movements of a football player during game or training sessions a first version
of a Web App that allowed one to visualize basic metrics inferred using an Extended
Kalman Filter (executed in an offline manner) to combine the GNSS IMU and
Compass readings from the tracker. Yet the</p>

<p><img src="system.png" width=800></p>

<h2 id="slam-for-football-analytics">SLAM for football analytics</h2>

<p>To improve upon the estimation results that could be achieved with our first
prototype algorithm, we teamed up with sensor fusion experts from
<a href="http://www.knowtion.de/" target="_blank">Knowtion</a> to develop a new and more powerful
estimation approach based on the the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/gtborg/gtsam/" target="_blank">GTSAM
library</a> - a toolkit commonly used
for SLAM (Similtaneous Localization and Mapping) applications and other
types of robotics and vision. GTSAM is implemented in C++, uses Factor Graphs
and Bayes Networks as its underlying compute paradigm and provides a modern
IMU preintegration scheme and convenient Python bindings for rapid prototyping.</p>

<p><img src="factorgraph.png" width=600></p>

<p>In the initial stages of designing our algorithm we were faced with the question
whether to go for near real-time online estimation, which is supported by
GTSAM&rsquo;s iSAM2 module, which &hellip; in small increments. Yet, since initial
experiments showed slightly better estimation results for the more conventional
batch processing approach, that allows to better account for the estimation of
global parameters (such as the local magnetic field at the recording location or
hardware-related corrections such IMU and magnetometer biases and scaling
factors). Thus, in light of our premisse to ensure as high quality estimation
results as possible&hellip;</p>

<p>Our sensor fusion algorithms are compute intensive Therefore the task at hand
doesn&rsquo;t clearly fit, but since our sensor fusion algorithm involves. Online vs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Relatively generous latency requirements of a few minutes. Users can see the
estimation results after 3-5 minutes. As our user journey involves a few steps
where the user is asked to input meta information about their data (e.g. adding
geographic coordinates of the football pitch or events) the perceived waiting
time could be reduced.</p></li>

<li><p>As our sensor hardware has relatively narrow price and dimension constraints
and regulatory reasons (the current regulations on sensory hardware that may
be applied during &hellip; games, put forward by FIFA, real-time capabilities that
would allow the) TRACKTICS opted for an approach where data analysis is entirely
performed in the cloud.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stitching-it-together">Stitching it together</h2>

<!---
>DESCRIBE THAT WE HAD TO COME UP WITH SOME WAY TO DO
>WRITE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BATCH PROCESSING VS STREAM PROCESSING
-->

<p>As soon as we were happy with the overall performance of our algorithm w.r.t.
the groundtruth data that we had collected, we were facing the challenge to
run. In the rrecent years, there have been a number of blog posts (see, for
example, the interesting
<a href="http://tech.adroll.com/blog/data/2015/09/22/data-pipelines-docker.html" target="_blank">article</a>
by Ville Tuulos from AdRoll, which was one of the inspirations for our
pipeline) describing architectures, that are meant to handle quite similar
batch processing type workloads as ours. Interestingly, these architectures
often converge to a surprisingly similar configuration, based on the
following main building blocks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An object storage solution like Amazons S3 (Simple Storage Solution) which is
used like a cloud-native equivalent to a computers file system.</p></li>

<li><p>Docker for dependency management, that allows for a clearer separation of
domains between application development and deployment/operation of the
batch processing workflow.</p></li>

<li><p>A container orchestrator (like Kubernetes or Amazon EC2 Container Service)
combined with some Auto-Scaling solution (with a custom scaling logic) for
resource management.</p></li>

<li><p>A workflow manager to stich together the workflow (like Spotify&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi" target="_blank">Luigi</a> or AirBnB&rsquo;s
<a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" target="_blank">Airflow</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, we also required the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A resilient messaging system (like Amazons Simple Queuing System
or Apache Kafka) as a fault-tolerant way to handle our job queue.</p></li>

<li><p>A REST API as a communication link between our batch processing pipeline and
the various client apps that allow our user to view their data.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="pipeline.png" width=800></p>

<p>In such an architecture, each (short-lived) Docker container is responsible for
running one to a few modules of a batch processing job. For example, in the
simplemost case there might be one container running our sensor fusion algorithm
and one container running some module to estimate soccer-related metrics (like
the number of sprints, etc.). Each container can be seen idempotent function which is applied
to a immutable piece of input data (a file on S3).</p>

<p>Docker comes in handy as it allows for an easy resource. Docker is mainstream,
and can be installed within an instance on a developers laptop, this facilitates
<a href="https://medium.com/machine-words/separation-of-concerns-1d735b703a60" target="_blank">separation of
concerns</a>
which, in our case, means that different modules along our pipeline are
maintained by different people. The fact that building and running a Docker
container locally is extremely easy, ensures that application developers can
independently test their builds. If their containers runs locally its guaranteed
to run in the production environment. As S3 is so cheap to use it is even
affordable to store intermediate results upon demand, which simplifies detailed
inspection of the data for troubleshooting.</p>

<p>As a workflow manager we opted for <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi" target="_blank">Luigi</a>
open-sourced by by Spotify in 2015. Spotify doesn&rsquo;t comprise as many features
compared to the more common alternative Airflow (by AirBnB), but is much more
lightweight and easier to set up, which was the main reason for our choice.</p>

estimation algorithm. The only way to test such changes with. Important is to
not overoptimize for a particular groundtruth dataset, but to find a good
balance between groundtruth fit for different datasets.</p>

<p><img src="groundtruth_fit1.png" width=600></p>

<p>Our grundtruth data  includes a plethora of data from real game data, to jogging
sessions where we have determined true distances, to high-precicion estimates of
GNSS positions and velocities, acquired with an expensive RTK GNSS receiver, to
light barrier data.</p>

<p>I will also touch upon some other aspects, like our
groundtruth based evaluation approaches and our growing from a few early
adopters after our product launch in 2017 to by now over 10000 active users
all over Germany, Switzerland and Austria, thus becoming the market leader in the DACH region.</p>

<!-- I will also touch upon some other aspects, like our  -->

<!-- groundtruth based evaluation approaches and our growing from a few early  -->

<!-- adopters after our product launch in 2017 to by now over 10000 active users  -->

<!-- all over Germany, Switzerland and Austria, thus becoming the market leader in the DACH region. -->

<!-- developing techniques to build up a database of  -->

<!-- groundtruth and associated evaluation and testing approaches, and finally,  -->

<!-- setting up a highly-available and fault tolerant data analysis pipeline  -->

<!-- ("pipeline" in the following) - interestingly enough,  -->

<!-- not to speak of growing from a few early adopters after our product launch in 2017 to by  -->

<!-- now over 10000 active users all over Germany, Switzerland and Austria, thus  -->

<!-- becoming the market leader in the DACH region. -->

<!-- Before I joined TRACKTICS Tech team in 2016, TRACKTICS had already developed  -->

<!-- a powerful GNSS-IMU based sensor hardware tailored for the for the logging of  -->

<!-- movements of a football player during game or training sessions, a first version  -->

<!-- of a Web App that allowed one to visualize basic metrics inferred using an Extended  -->

<!-- Kalman Filter (executed in an offline manner) to combine the GNSS IMU and -->

<!-- Compass readings from the tracker. Yet, the estimation results of this early  -->

<!-- incarnation of the system was not sufficient in terms of estimation quality and  -->

<!-- there existed significant "blind-spots" as to how accurate the system was -->

<!-- operating overall, due to a still rather basic testing and evaluation framework.  -->

<!-- To solve this challenge we embarked on a very interesting journey of months of  -->

<!-- optimizing our algorithms, developing techniques to build up a database of  -->

<!-- groundtruth and associated evaluation and testing approaches, and finally,  -->

<!-- setting up a highly-available and fault tolerant data analysis pipeline  -->

<!-- ("pipeline" in the following) - interestingly enough, not to speak of  -->
