      <description>Introduction At TRACKTICS we try to bring sophisticated tactical analytics and performance stats (have so far been reserved to elite clubs and players) to the lower leagues, by developing a GNSS-IMU based tracking solution that fits the tight budgets of an average amatuer football player or coach, but is yet accurate enough to provide valuable insights for injury prevention and training control.
One of the key ideas that we put forward when trying to meet the aforementioned requirements was to repurpose methods from the field of sensor fusion, commonly used in fields like autonomous driving or robotics, for the use case of football data enrichment, thus accounting for potential shortcomings in raw data quality caused by inexpensive hardware components and allowing our system to achieve state-of-the art accuracy akin to that of much more expensive systems.</description>
